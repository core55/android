# JoinUp Android App

The official JoinUp app for Android. JoinUp allows people to spontaneously meet up anywhere and see the location of their friends on a map.

## Beta

**The app has been removed from Google Play Store and relative beta program.**

## Getting started

We are using Android Studio (on the beta channel) as our IDE with Gradle for build automation.  

To switch to the beta channel, go to `Help > Check for Updates...`, click on "Updates" and select `Beta Channel` for the automatic updates. Check for updates and install them.
